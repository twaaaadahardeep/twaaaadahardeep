### My favorite project
[GoChat](https://github.com/twaaaadahardeep/chat-go-gRPC) - I learned about gRPC and protobufs. It was interesting building the chat app using the bi-directional streaming capabilities of gRPC instead of the commonly used websockets for chat applications. I am planning to extend this application later on, with persisted data about users, chatrooms, and chat history.
